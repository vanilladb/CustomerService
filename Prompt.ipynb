Some people have this habit, but it kills the tree. Please leave the Flora app open. (2) Keep the version of your iOS and Flora app up to date. (3) Make sure you have a stable Internet connection.

(4) The iOS system may actively kill apps under some circumstances, such as when it faces memory pressure or when the phone is locked for a long time.

      "647. I was just curious as to how you could unlock stop 5, UK, on the grand tour. I'm not sure why but I've cleared stop 6 with the non-zero price and over 25+ minutes of focus time, as that was my interpretation of how to unlock the stop 5 plant, but I don't think that was what I was meant to do. \n",

For the iPhone widget, the one that covers 1/3 of the screen (8 icons worth) would it be possible to let it be so that the person who is ahead can actually see themselves winning?
